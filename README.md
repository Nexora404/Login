# Login Form

A simple, clean login form web page built by **nexora404**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a basic login page hosted on GitHub Pages. The form includes:

- Username field  
- Password field  
- “Remember me” checkbox  
- A link to sign up  
- A “show password” toggle  

It’s a frontend-only implementation (pure HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript), designed for demonstration or UI practice.
